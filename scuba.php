                        Our instructors will guide you through the <span class="blue-text">open water certification</span>, but it is recommended that new divers bring a referral from their home country where they would have been taught basic pool work and skills sessions, along with paper work, video, classroom and a written exam.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With your approved documents, the <span class="blue-text">open water certification</span>, which comprises of <span class="blue-text">four dives over two days</span>, will commence under direct supervision of one of our experienced instructors who will make learning both educational and fun.

                        <span class="blue-text">PADI certification</span> is not a requirement, all that’s needed is completion of the medical questionnaire for our review, then you are on your way to experiencing the underwater adventure that is <span class="blue-text">diving in the TCI</span>.
